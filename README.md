# Workflomics - CWL tool descriptions

This repository contains the CWL tool descriptions and other files used to execute workflows generated by the [Workflomics](https://github.com/Workflomics/workflomics-frontend) interface.
They are normally executed using the [Workflomics Benchmarker](https://github.com/Workflomics/workflomics-benchmarker) 
or using the [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) (or other CWL runner).

When using Workflomics web interface, workflows are referencing this repository directly. They are downloaded during the workflow execution, so you don't need to clone this repository for normal usage in the Workflomics environment.

To add new tools to the Workflomics environment, CWL files and other files needed to run these tools should be added to this repository.
